# Linear-Regression-Health-Costs-Calculator

### Developed a healthcare cost prediction model using regression algorithms to predict expenses with a Mean Absolute Error under $3500

This project was part of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning curriculum, where I developed a healthcare cost prediction model using regression algorithms. Working in Google Colaboratory, I cleaned and processed a dataset containing various personal information and healthcare costs. I converted categorical data to numerical values, split the dataset into training and testing sets, and trained a regression model. The model was evaluated to ensure a Mean Absolute Error under $3500, ensuring accurate cost predictions.
